`npm install`

`node app.js` then the spider will crawl the novel.

Recommend to use devtool to start the node app.

Such as `devtool app.js`.

You can config the crawl url in the app.js but I do not promise it will work normally. 

It just a practice demo.

Will add a front-end show with socket as soon.
